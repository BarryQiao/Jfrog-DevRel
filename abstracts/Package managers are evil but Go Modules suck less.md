# Package Managers Are Evil, But Go Modules Suck Less #

## Abstract (~750 characters) ##

Tis impossible to be sure of anything but Death and Taxes... Or dependencies in software! Let's face it, package managers were invented in hell to make us all miserable. Luckily, though, Go Modules suck less. In this talk, we’ll go over “the seven deadly sins” of package management and why Go Modules has absolutely learned from those experiences.

## Talk description ##

Most of the package managers in the world are less than optimal (and that might be an understatement). That doesn't mean that the authors who created them are stupid or didn’t know what they are doing, though. Surprisingly, package management is about people, not technology, and people are weird, unpredictable and hard to work with (let's be honest and agree we are all a little difficult).

We’ll discuss "the seven deadly sins" of package management, and how the existing package managers suffer from them; And then we’ll talk about how Go Modules learned from the industry experience and delivered what looks like a huge step forward for Go (and the benefits over previous solutions).
