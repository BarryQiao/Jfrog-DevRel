# Trusting Your Ingredients - Knowing What Makes Up Your App

## Abstract

I have a confession to make. I love writing code almost as much as I love cheesecake. As a developer, I’ve written code and built apps, and I realized that building apps and creating a cheesecake have a lot in common. In both cases you need to have the right ingredients, you need to trust your suppliers and have transparency in your production process. In this talk, we'll look at how you can, and why you should, know what is in the app you deploy.

## Description

As a developer, I always thought that security, like documentation, would be done by someone else. While that might have been true in the past, in today’s world that model no longer works. As a developer you’re responsible for the security of your app. Security in this case should be seen in the broadest sense of the word, ranging from licenses to software packages. A chef creating cheesecake has similar challenges. The ingredients of a cheesecake are similar to the software packages a developer uses. The preparation is similar to the DevOps pipeline, and recipe is similar to the licenses for developers. Messing up any of those means you have a messy kitchen, or a data breach!

In this talk we'll look at:

* Why do we care about licenses?
* How does Sec get into the early stages of DevSecOps?
* What can chefs and devs learn from each other?

## Notes

This is a talk about general approaches and best practices of software development, not a product pitch :smile:
