# DevOps in the Cloud: A Story of Three S's

DevOps has been around for quite a while, though the understanding that it's not just a tool but a mindset seems to still be missing at companies. With the rise of Cloud, and especially Cloud-Native, a second massive change in mindset is taking place as we're all figuring out how we move to the cloud in the best possible way. DevOps in the cloud is a story of three S's:

- Serverless: By no means does serverless mean we're moving to a world where Ops isn't needed. In fact, I think that the specialty of Ops is even more important in a serverless world where there is no "server" you can debug;
- Secure: One of the latest additions to the DevOps family has been DevSecOps and that makes total sense. Over the past several months we've seen massive data breaches so knowing what you're deploying and how you're deploying is a matter of life and death for companies;
- Speed: How often does "the Business" say that a new feature can wait a few weeks to a new deployment cycle? What if your patch needs to go in production in the next few hours so fix a massive bug? Speed is becoming, if it wasn't already, a critical factor in how we deploy apps and what processes we follow.

In this session we'll touch on all three elements as we're walking through a live example, deploying apps in a speedy, secure, and serverless manner.
