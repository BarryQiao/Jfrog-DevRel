# DevOps in the Cloud: A Story of Three S's #

## Abstract (~750 characters) ##

In many DevOps talks, you see a speaker from the most amazing companies stand up and describe the perfect world of DevOps. Your environment looks nothing like that and with the digital transformation that companies are undertaking these days (and the awesome buzzwords that accompany it) you feel you're getting behind even further. Fear not, DevOps in the Cloud is possible for everyone and we'll demonstrate that with live examples.

## Talk description ##

DevOps has been around for quite a while, though the understanding that it's not just a tool but a mindset seems to still be missing at companies. With the rise of Cloud, and especially Cloud-Native, a second massive change in mindset is taking place as we're all figuring out how we move to the cloud in the best possible way. DevOps in the cloud is a story of three S's:

- Serverless: By no means does serverless mean we're moving to a world where Ops isn't needed. In fact, I think that the specialty of Ops is even more important in a serverless world where there is no "server" you can debug;
- Secure: One of the latest additions to the DevOps family has been DevSecOps and that makes total sense. Over the past several months we've seen massive data breaches so knowing what you're deploying and how you're deploying is a matter of life and death for companies;
- Speed: How often does "the Business" say that a new feature can wait a few weeks to a new deployment cycle? What if your patch needs to go in production in the next few hours so fix a massive bug? Speed is becoming, if it wasn't already, a critical factor in how we deploy apps and what processes we follow.

In this session we'll touch on all three elements as we're walking through a live example, deploying apps in a speedy, secure, and serverless manner.

## Notes ##

A surprising amount of people think that with the rise of serverless we don't need any ops (NoOps) or that it only means running functions (FaaS). As developers we tend to treat security as a second-class citizen (together with documentation, and yes I did that too..), but with the many security breaches we've seen it's clear we can no longer do that.
