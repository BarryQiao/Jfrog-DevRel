## Talk description ##
We asked a Fortune 500 software delivery leaders what holds them back. This talk is the analysis of their insights on what bottlenecks they encountered in their DevOps journey. We share discoveries on what helped them to overcome the bottlenecks and how they plan to deliver even faster. Using this we define some unifying themes on what areas provide the greatest return in investments of time and resources.

## Notes ##
JFrog has a portfolio of more than 4K customers, with 8 out of 10 biggest software vendors, 8 out of 10 biggest telecom companies, and 7 out of 10 financial and retail companies, so we have a very good target audience for such a study. Some facts that we discovered during this study are real eye openers.
