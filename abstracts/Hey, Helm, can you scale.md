# Hey, Helm, can you scale? #

## Abstract ##
Package managers are hard. Helm learned a lot of lessons from others’ mistakes, but also repeated some. In this talk, we’ll discuss those mistakes and explore several solutions, their strengths, and their weaknesses.

## Talk description ##
Package managers are hard. Helm learned a lot of lessons from others’ mistakes, but also repeated some. For example, having a single index file per repository is not scalable. It’s the same mistake that NPM made and it causes slower CI, high memory consumption, slower searches, and more. Another example is not having private enterprise repositories in mind, leaving out authorization and authentication features. In this talk, we’ll explore several solutions to those problems, their strengths, and their weaknesses.
