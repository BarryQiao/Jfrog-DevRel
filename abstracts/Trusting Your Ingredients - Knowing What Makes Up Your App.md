# Trusting Your Ingredients - Knowing What Makes Up Your App #

## Abstract (~750 characters) ##

Making chocolate and writing software have a lot more in common than you might think. In both cases you need to have the right ingredients, you need to trust your suppliers and have transparency in your production process. In this talk, we'll look at how you can (and should) know what is in the app you deploy.

## Talk description ##

Building software is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get. That is obviously a big challenge as it's more important than ever to know what you're putting in your app in terms of code and licenses. If you're deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster it gets even more challenging, and important, because the container you're running your app in now plays a role too.
Let's look at building software in the same way as assembling a box of chocolates. To make the best chocolates, you don't only need the best ingredients (dependencies), you also need to trust your suppliers (vulnerabilities, licenses). As you're putting your box together (pipeline) you want full transparency in what makes it to your consumers.
During the session weâ€™ll look at:

* Building an app and looking at it's dependencies
* Validating the licenses and looking at vulnerabilities
* Knowing what is in your cluster and taking action
