# DevOps Theory vs. Practice: A Song of Ice and TireFire

## Abstract

In many talks, you hear how everything is DevOps unicorns and rainbows, and you feel like you’re the last person on earth with “suboptimal” processes, tools and environment. But no despair, DevOps talks are like Instagram, hаve nothing to do with the real life. In this talk, we’ll reveal the truth.

## Talk description

In many DevOps talks, you see a speaker from a renowned tech company stand up and describe a perfect utopia of an environment. You look at the perfect environment and dedicated hordes of senior engineers they describe, and you despair of ever getting to that point. Your environment looks nothing like that.

Surprise– their environment doesn’t really look like that either! In this talk, a speaker from an unnamed tech unicorn describes their amazing environment– and then what they just said gets translated from “thought leader” into plain English for you by an official translator. Stop feeling sad– everything is secretly terrible!

## Notes

That’s a pair talk: the first part is pure fun: thought leadership speaker and his real-world translator. In the second part, we are going into the details of how to evaluate technology (hype or the real deal?) and how to know whether your team is ready to adopt it?
